''' Customer Analytics for E-commerce Platform: Build an ETL pipeline using Apache Spark to process customer data from an e-commerce platform and generate analytics reports. Customer Data: Customer details like name, email, address, signup date, etc. Order Data: Information about orders, products, prices, timestamps, quantities, etc. Product Data: Product details like name, category, price, stock, etc. Shipping Data: Shipping details including delivery times, status, etc. You can use publicly available datasets or create a synthetic dataset using tools like Mockaroo or Faker to generate data for this purpose.

Ingest Data from Various Sources: Assume that the data comes from CSV, Parquet, or JSON files Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values (impute or drop missing values). Convert timestamps and data types as needed. calculate the running total of orders Calculate key metrics like total order value per customer, average order size Filter data for customers who spent over a certain threshold >500 rs spent Perform transformations to identify the highest-value product category, or calculate the longest shipping delays by joining product and shipping data you could plot the distribution of customer spending or visualize the shipping delays for top products[Matplotlib/Seaborn to visualize trends]

Conclusion: Which product categories generate the most revenue What are the key characteristics of high-value customers. Average shipping times by product category.'''

Overview

This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for e-commerce analytics using PySpark in Databricks. The pipeline processes raw e-commerce transaction data, performs transformations, and generates insights such as customer spending behavior, product popularity, and shipping performance.
